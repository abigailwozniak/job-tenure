DATA NOTES ON CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY (CPS) DATA FOR MOLLOY, SMITH, AND WOZNIAK "CHANGING STABILITY IN US EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS"

Tenure data:

Data for the job tenure and occupational mobility supplement in 1996-2020 come from the IPUMS. 

The necessary variables to extract from IPUMS are:

year
age
sex
educ
marst
empstat
classwkr
ind1990
occ1990
jtsuppwt
jtyears
race
marst

During the early stage of our research, we discovered that tenure variables for earlier years in IPUMS were incorrectly coded.  We think that these issues have been resolved, but have continued using NBER/ICPSR extracts for earlier years.  For 1987 and 1991, we use the ICPSR extract, because the NBER extract appeared to be corrupted; we use the NBER extract for 1983.

To process 1983 tenure supplement data (occupational mobility, training, and tenure):
nber data codebook: http://data.nber.org/cps/cpsjan83.pdf
nber raw data: http://data.nber.org/cps/cpsjan83.zip
code for extracting necessary variables: dataclean_1983.do

To process 1987 tenure supplement data (occupational mobility, training, and tenure):
ICPSR codebook and data: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/8913/datadocumentation#
code for extracting necessary variables: dataclean_1987.do

To process 1991 tenure data (training supplement):
ICPSR codebook and data: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/9716
code for extracting necessary variables: dataclean_1991.do

For generating measures of separation rates, we use IPUMS provided data to the Annual Social and Economic Supplement Survey:

Samples: 1962-2020
